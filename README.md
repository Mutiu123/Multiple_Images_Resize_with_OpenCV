This OpenCV-based image compression code is pivotal in optimizing storage, speeding up processing, and enhancing the efficiency of computer vision and deep learning workflows. The Python script leverages the OpenCV library to compress large images efficiently. Here’s how it works:
Overview of the Code:
A set of large images (e.g., photographs, scans, or frames from videos) was provided as input, while the script applied lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size while minimizing the impact on image quality. The compressed images are saved to a specified location, making them more manageable for storage, sharing, or further analysis.
Key Steps in the Code:
Image Loading: The script reads each input image using OpenCV’s cv2.imread() function.
Compression Algorithm: You likely employ techniques such as JPEG compression (which is lossy) to reduce the image size. This involves quantizing colour information and discarding some details.
Quality Control: You can adjust the compression level (often represented by a quality factor) to balance file size and visual fidelity. Higher quality retains more details but results in larger files.
Saving Compressed Images: The script uses cv2.imwrite() to save the compressed images to disk.
Dealing with large datasets is common in computer vision and deep learning pipelines. Compressed images will significantly reduce storage requirements, allowing efficient data management. Similarly, Smaller image files lead to faster data loading during training or inference. This speedup is crucial for real-time applications and large-scale experiments.
